# URBN-Project
Coding Assignment from URBN

I was asked to make a simple app that interfaces with a public open API. I chose 
the Accuweather API and created an app called "Wear-ther". I used SpringBoot to 
connect to the API and Vue.js for the front end work. The app takes the postal code 
that is inputed by the user and displays the current weather conditions and temperature. Depending 
on those conditions you are given two links Tops & Bottoms (shirts/pants) to appropiate clothing 
styles. For example if its above 80 degrees the "Bottoms" link will send you to shorts, otherwise 
you'll get a link for pants. I think you'll recognize the website used for clothing ðŸ‘€

This was my first project outside the ones I had at Tech Elevator. I didn't have time for side-
projects during the bootcamp because of all the learning that was happening plus balacing family 
time with a 6 month old. Working on this was a challenging, fun, and growing experience. I know 
there are countless places where this app could improve and things that I have a vision for to make 
it better BUT regardless I'm really really proud of what I've built. From knowing next to nothing about 
coding the beginning of January this year, to building THIS. Feels. So. Good. I'm stoked to come back to 
this and continue to add/make changes as I grow in my development skills. Thanks URBN for this opportunity 
and to be challenged in a new way. In the many places I've been applying it is near and far-between when 
you get to design something from scratch as part of the interview process. Definetly a nice break from 
the "normal" code assessments I've been doing a lot of.
